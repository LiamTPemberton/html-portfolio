<h3>Dead Mans Shoes</h3>
<p>Gripping and dark physcological revenge thriller. There's a fantastic twist at the end and the acting is superb.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>A wonderful story about finding your way in the world. We follow Forrest from childhood as he makes his way into some of the biggest moments in U.S History.</p>
<h3>This is Spinal Tap</h3>
<p>The funniest film I have ever seen. I quote it all the time. Following the mishaps of a once great band on a U.S tour. The songs are actually fantastic too.</p>
